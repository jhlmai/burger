# burger



This burger eating app will let you fill in a form to add a new burger.
You then could DEVOUR any burger on the list that has the "Devour it!" button. 
That burger will then populate onto the next list showing all of the previously devoured burgers.

This app was made using MySQL, Node.js, Express, and Handlebars. 

The files are organized using the MVC pattern.
